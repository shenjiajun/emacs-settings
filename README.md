emacs-settings
==============

My emacs settings open to public reference.

The themes (zenburn https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs and solarized https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs ) were downloaded from Internet and have their own copyrights. Please check it before you use 3rd party tools.

All other files are free to download and use.


Install
-------

If you don't have .emacs just copy the file .emacs and folder .emacs.d to your ~/ folder (in Windows 7 you may find ~ is mapped to C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming)

If you have .emacs I would suggst you just open the file in browser and copy code snippets you need.

Happy coding with emacs!
